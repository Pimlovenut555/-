## Introduction

This document states the leadership team's objectives for ASVS 5.0.

Note the [Planned Timescales](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/wiki/Roadmap-to-version-5.0#planned-timescales) below.

We want to publish this publicly so that our direction is clear. All changes/issues to be handled for 5.0 should be mapped to one of these objectives.

Our driving philosophy for 5.0 is to increase usability and lower the barrier to entry.

## Key Objectives

The following sections will highlight our key objectives together with basic actions for each.

### Basic/Standard objectives

* Deduplicate existing requirements
* Clarify or correct existing requirements
* Add new requirements but only if we specifically feel they are important or someone in the community is prepared to provide us with a good draft.

### Clearer levels 

* Make level rationale clearer (maybe use AAL as inspiration)
* Move level 1 items into level 2 to make a lower barrier to entry.
* Be clear that level 1 does not prove compliance, only level 2 and 3.
* Have an export option and an export artefact for “ASVS lite”

### Mappings

* Move all mappings including CWE and NIST to a separate location.
* Make clear that we do not maintain mappings other than CWE and NIST and any others are community contributed/maintained.
* We should make sure this is clearly documented in ASVS and in the README?

### Streamlined document:
* Move explanatory text to the end of the document.
* Remove or reduce as much explanatory text as possible from around the requirements in the individual chapters as we don’t think anyone is reading it. References we should keep.

## Planned timescales

We are planning to work towards the timescales below and we would appreciate the community's help with this!

* We will review any issues opened before the end of May 2022.
* June 2022-July 2022 - discussion of open comments.
* August 2022-October 2022 - writing 5.0 draft 
* November 2022 - December 2022 - comments and refinement to 5.0 draft (**no major changes**)
* Release near end of December 2022.
